# Blueprint — 57Blocks Agentic Engineering OS

Blueprint is a Context-First Agentic Engineering OS built for 57Blocks. It orchestrates a structured multi-agent dialogue before a single line of code is written, producing a **Unified Context Package** (`.blueprint/`) that serves as the single source of truth for all downstream execution.

**Operating philosophy**: Define → Verify → Implement → Iterate. Not Generate → Patch → Patch → Rewrite.

## 🔄 The Agent Pipeline

```
── DEFINE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  /create-prd          PM Agent       →  .blueprint/PRD_V{N}.md
  /create-ui-spec      Design Agent   →  .blueprint/UI_Spec.md
  /create-mockup       Mockup Agent   →  .blueprint/mockup/
  /review-mockup       Review Agent   →  reports/mockup-reviews/   ⟲ loop until approved
  /create-tech-spec    Dev Agent      →  .blueprint/Tech_Spec.md
  /create-test-spec    QA Agent       →  .blueprint/Test_Spec.md   ← before coding
  /verify              Global Verify  →  reports/verify/

── IMPLEMENT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  /create-plan         Plan Agent     →  plans/[feature].md
  /execute             Exe Agent      →  (reads all .blueprint/ as mission briefing)
  /review              Review Agent   →  code quality + drift detection
  /test                Test Agent     →  reports/test-runs/
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### New project

```
1. Read .blueprint/CONTEXT.md to understand current state
2. Run /create-prd  — generate product requirements
3. Follow the pipeline above, step by step
4. Never skip /verify before /create-plan
```

### New iteration on existing project

```
1. Read .blueprint/CONTEXT.md
2. Run /create-prd in iteration mode — updates PRD_V{N}.md with new iteration
3. Update downstream docs as needed (UI Spec, Tech Spec, Test Spec)
4. Run /verify to check cross-document consistency
5. Run /create-plan and /execute
```

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

**Why `.blueprint/` instead of `docs/`**
All specification documents live in `.blueprint/` to signal their role: they are machine-readable context, not just human documentation. Every agent reads from here before doing anything.

**Why Test Spec before coding**
`/create-test-spec` runs after Tech Spec is approved and before `/execute`. This makes the acceptance criteria a constraint on coding, not a post-hoc check. The Exe Agent reads the Test Spec as part of its Mission Briefing.

**Why `/verify` exists**
Before any code is written, all five specification documents (PRD, UI Spec, Tech Spec, Test Spec, Mockup) must be consistent with each other. `/verify` catches contradictions at the cheapest possible moment — before implementation begins.

**Why PRD is versioned (PRD_V1.md, PRD_V2.md)**
Each major version file is cumulative: it contains the full "current state" section (what AI reads when coding) plus an "iteration history" section (why decisions were made). This gives AI agents full context without requiring them to piece together multiple files.

**Why `/execute` has a mandatory Mission Briefing**
The Exe Agent reads Tech Spec, UI Spec, mockup, and Test Spec before touching any code. This is the primary mechanism preventing implementation drift. If the implementation conflicts with any spec, the agent stops and reports — it does not make assumptions.

## 🛠️ Customization

All agent behavior is defined in `.cursor/commands/*.md`. Each file contains the full system prompt for that agent. Edit them to adjust behavior for specific project types, tech stacks, or team conventions.

When modifying commands, remember to keep the Step 0 context-reading sections intact — they are what give agents the cross-document awareness that prevents drift.
